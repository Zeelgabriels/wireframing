# Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## Introduction to Wireframing

### What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app. Think of it as the blueprint of a building — it shows the basic layout, structure, and intended functionality without the decorative details like colours, fonts, or images.

### Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
Wireframes are essential in the design process because they:
- Focus on functionality and user flow before design aesthetics
- Help identify usability issues early in the process
- Align stakeholders (designers, developers, clients) around structure and expectations
- Save time and cost by resolving issues before development starts
- Provide a clear roadmap for development teams to follow
- Allow teams to test and refine user journeys before investing in detailed design and coding

### When are Wireframes Used?
Wireframes are typically created early in the design process—before visual design or development begins—making them essential for gathering feedback and enabling iteration without costly changes later.


## Key Elements of Wireframing

### 1. Layout Structure
- Defines the placement and proportion of sections on the screen (e.g., header, sidebar, main content). A well-structured layout creates visual hierarchy and guides users naturally through content.

### 2. Navigation
- Shows how users move between screens and sections. This includes menus, breadcrumbs, or sidebars. Wireframes help clarify primary vs. secondary navigation paths.

### 3. Content Placement
- Focuses on the positioning of images, text blocks, buttons, and inputs. This allows teams to agree on information priority before styling is applied.

### 4. Functionality
- Outlines key interactive elements (e.g., buttons, forms, modals). Wireframes help plan for user actions without being distracted by visual styling.

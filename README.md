# Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## Introduction to Wireframing

### What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product such as a website or mobile app.

Think of it as the blueprint of a building — it shows the basic layout, structure, and intended functionality, how it connects, but without the decorative details like colors, fonts, or images.without the visual polish.


### Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframes are essential because they:
- Focus on functionality and user flow before design aesthetics
- Help identify usability issues early
- Align stakeholders (designers, developers, clients) around structure and expectations
- Save time and cost by resolving issues before development starts


### Why it Matters

Wireframing is crucial because it allows designers and developers to focus on functionality and user experience without getting distracted by visual elements. It helps teams communicate ideas clearly, saves time and money by identifying potential issues early, and provides a clear roadmap for the development team to follow. By wireframing first, we can test and refine the user journey before investing time in detailed design and coding.

### When are Wireframes used in the Design Process?

- Wireframes are typically created early in the design process—before visual design or development begins—making them essential for feedback and iteration.
